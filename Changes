Revision history for Devel-Examine::Subs

1.59    2016-01-14
        - 100% test coverage!
        - when file param is a directory, we now use the copy param as a dir,
          create that dir, and copy all the files in the file param to it, and
          operate on those (in operations that write to files)
        - closes #2; add_functionality() now checks to see if the sub being
          added already exists
        - closes #1; true value at end of module remains in the correct place

1.58    20151230
        - _proc() now sets $p->{order}, which keeps track of the original order
          of subs in the file being worked on 
        - added order(), returns the list of sub names in the order they appear
          in the file
        - fixed minor issues in a couple of unit test files (file cleanup on 
          windows wasn't working correctly)
        - removed 'blead' from travis
        - win32 tests in CPAN Testers should be ok again after last dev version
        - re-enable t/24-preproc (seems to be working on win32 again)

1.57_01   20151120
        - certain deprications will be necessary after the rest of the module is
          rewritten to use PPI where it currently isn't
        - reworked _read_file(), it now populates $self->{params}{file_contents}
          from a PPI doc
        - _proc() modified to use PPI to get the sub code from the file, instead
          of extracting it out manually out of an array slice by counting
          line nums
        - $subs struct no longer has a copy of the entire file contents in each
          sub. This reduces the size of the data and all objects significantly

1.56    20151029
        - no noticeable functional changes
        - most examples have been removed as unnecessary
        - extra check put in before we clobber *trace() in BEGIN

1.55    20151022
        - no functional changes
        - runs down to perl v5.8
        - removed all features beyond 5.8 (defined-or, each on array etc)

1.53    20151019
        - reorganized tests as extensions.t was breaking on windows due to
          the same number of files not being used

1.52    20151016
        - inject() with line_num param now uses File::Edit::Portable::splice()
        - inject() w/ inject_use param uses the same as inject() w/ line_num

1.51    20151015
        - API CHANGE: extensions param changed to accept what File::Find::Rule::name
          takes, as opposed to just the extensions less the dot
        - _run_directory() now uses File::Edit::Portable::dir() for finding
          files
        - Travis-CI integration
        - inject() now allows a line_num param along with a code param, will
          inject the block of code in the array ref immediately after the
          line number in the file
        - File::Find prereq removed, we now use File::Edit::Portable for everything
        - add_functionality() now injects the new sub, updates the dispatch table in 
          all three core phases (pre_proc, engine, post_proc)

1.46    20150930
        - renamed everything from pre_filter to post_proc
        - removed test that was failing across platforms (t/24)

1.45    20150930
        - module() now allows just a single string param "$des->module('Data::Dumper')".
          backwards compatibility has remained
        - _read_file() now uses File::Edit::Portable read()
        - _write_file() now uses File::Edit::Portable write()
        - internally, _subs() has been renamed to _proc()
        - reduced the size of the data and instance by ~50% (according to core_dump)
        - new prereq: File::Basename (fixes bug where module file bak couldn't be saved)
        - fixed "use Symbol;" to import 'delete_package'
        - re-enabled t/24-pre-proc tests

1.43    20150923
        - search_replace() now takes a coderef that encompasses the substitution
          regex info
        - new replace() method, similar to search_replace(), but works on entire file. See
          examples/ver.pl
        - added/updated tests

1.41    20150922
        - fix problems with forcing CPAN Testers to honour perl v5.012
        - disabled t/24 preproc tests

1.39    20150921
        - Tie::File no longer needed, we have our own built-in read/write methods
        - upon reading in a file, the line endings are saved, then completely removed
          prior to the file array being populated. Upon write, the saved line endings
          are added back in to each line
        - hundreds of new tests across numerous files
        - fixed a couple bugs in inject_after() relating to Tie::File removal
        - modules now have their version applied in the 'package' line
        - min perl version is 5.012;

1.35    20150917
        - reworked Makefile.PL, allows tests on MSWin32 to pass
        - we now look in all files to determine and set line-ending
          characters program-wide
        - added a '\r\n' file and added a test

1.33    20150916
        - re-added Devel::Trace::Subs integration in a way that the module
          won't break install if DTS isn't installed

1.32    20150915
        - moved repo from bitbucket to https://github.com/stevieb9/devel-examine-subs
        - removed Devel::Trace::Subs integration... breaks CPAN install because of
          the circular dependency

1.31    20150915
        - Devel::Trace::Subs has been introduced. See DEBUGGING in
          'perldoc Devel::Examine::Subs'
        - code injection now has much more reliable indenting

1.30    20150914
        - inject_after() no longer adds a new empty line after code is
          inserted
