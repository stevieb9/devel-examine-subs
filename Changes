        - countless bug fixes        

1.17    20150715
        - implemented PPI sub checking, much safer
        - removed the old _subs() that was not PPI-based
        - most everything is OO based now

        - bug 13 fix: new() now accepts 'file' param
        - new test for 'search'
        - many other test additions/updates
        - test for ::Sub
        - test for _config()

        - cleaned up POD/Readme

1.07    20150630
        - added sublist()
        - similar to line_numbers(), but returns a list of
